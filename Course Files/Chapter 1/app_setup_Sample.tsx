----- Project Scope -----
In order to take a dive into Typescript with Redux, let's create a simple app to fetch a bunch of todos
from an API and display them on-screen. We'll add a delete functionality and make sure to implement lots
of type definitions and interfaces!

----- Project Setup -----
Firstly, go ahead and navigate to a directory you'd like to create the project in and type:
npx create-react-app yourfancyappname --template typescript
then we need to install some dependencies:
npm install redux react-redux axios redux-thunk
redux-thunk is going to allow us to handle some async API requests from inside an action-creator
Now that we have our app set up, go ahead and delete everything that comes in the src folder by default.
Create a new index.tsx file and let's add some of our dependencies:
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from "redux";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import thunk from "redux-thunk";

Now we need to add our store and pass in thunk as middleware:
const store = createStore(reducers, applyMiddleware(thunk));
Finally let's add our render method:
ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
if everything worked correctly you should see a few errors! Now the first should be around your import for
'react-redux' (which may be fixed in the future) but this is because react-redux's typescript definition
file doesn't download automatically. As you may recall, some packages will create custom definition files
for how typescript should define certain things in the package. So let's make sure we have those installed.
npm install @types/react-redux
You should at this point see the error dissapear, but this may be included by default in the 'react-redux'
package in the future

Next up, our App has an error because we don't have an App component yet. Let's fix that.
Make a 'components' directory and within it, an app.tsx file.
Within that file, go ahead and create a standard App component:
import React from "react";

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Hi there!</div>;
  }
}

Great! Save your file, flip back over to your index.tsx file and import your App component:
import { App } from "./components/App";

Next up, let's add our dummy reducer!
Make a reducers directory and within it, an index.ts file
We do also need to imnport our combineReducers function from redux
import { combineReducers } from "redux";

export const reducers = combineReducers({
  counter: () => 1
});

Perfect, we're all done here so lets flip back to index.tsx and import our reducers:
import { reducers } from "./reducers";

Let's give it a test now. Go ahead and type
npm start
and double check if you're seeing "Hi there!" in your browser at localhost:3000
In the next section we'll add an action creator to make API requests with redux thunk
